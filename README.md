# Fraud Analytics Projects

This repository contains multiple projects that focus on various aspects of fraud detection using financial transaction data. Each project has its own subfolder with a dedicated README.md file. All datasets required for the projects must be downloaded and placed in the respective folder according to the file structure outlined in each project's README.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Financial Transaction ETL Pipeline
- **Objective**: Build an ETL pipeline to process raw financial transaction data.
- **Key Features**:
  - Cleanses and validates transaction data.
  - Performs necessary transformations, including currency conversion and timestamp standardization.
  - Aggregates data at different time intervals.
  - Implements data quality checks and validation rules.
  - Creates summary statistics and data profiling reports.
- **Dataset**: [Synthetic Financial Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1/data)

### 2. Time Series Analysis for Fraud Detection
- **Objective**: Use time series analysis to identify fraud patterns in transactional data.
- **Key Features**:
  - Analyzes temporal patterns in fraudulent transactions.
  - Creates moving averages and identifies seasonal trends.
  - Develops statistical measures for anomaly detection.
  - Implements SQL window functions for time-based analysis.
  - Visualizes patterns and generates interpretable reports.
- **Dataset**: [IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection/data)

### 3. Large-Scale Data Processing with PySpark
- **Objective**: Implement a PySpark solution to process and analyze large-scale transaction data.
- **Key Features**:
  - Processes and transforms data using PySpark DataFrame operations.
  - Implements efficient data partitioning strategies.
  - Creates aggregations and statistical summaries.
  - Optimizes performance using appropriate Spark configurations.
  - Generates comprehensive data quality reports.
- **Dataset**: [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
